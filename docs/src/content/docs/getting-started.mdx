## Creating a new project

Starstruck is a full-featured documentation theme built on top of the [Astro](https://astro.build) framework.

You can create a new Astro + Starstruck project using the following command:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
# create a new project with npm
npm create astro@latest -- --template starstruck
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
# create a new project with pnpm
pnpm create astro --template starstruck
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
# create a new project with yarn
yarn create astro --template starstruck
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will create a new [project directory](/guides/project-structure/) with all the necessary files and configurations for your site.

## Creating content with Starstruck

Starstruck is ready for you to add new content, or bring your existing files!

### File formats

Starstruck supports authoring content in Markdown and MDX. (You can add support for Markdoc by installing the experimental [Astro Markdoc integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/markdoc/).)

### Add pages

Add new pages to your site automatically by creating `.md` or `.mdx` files in `src/content/docs/`. Add sub-folders to organize your files, and to create multiple path segments:

```
src/content/docs/hello-world.md => your-site.com/hello-world
src/content/docs/guides/faq.md => your-site.com/guides/faq
```

### Type-safe frontmatter

All Starstruck pages share a customizable [common set of frontmatter properties](/reference/frontmatter/) to control how the page appears:

```md
---
title: Hello, World!
description: This is a page in my Starstruck-powered site
---
```

If you forget anything important, Starstruck will let you know.

## Deploying your Starstruck website

Once you have created and customized your Starstruck website, you can deploy it to a web server or hosting platform of your choice including Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages and many more.

## Updating Starstruck

:::tip
Because Starstruck is beta software, there will be frequent updates and improvements. Be sure to update Starstruck regularly!
:::

Starstruck is an Astro integration, and is updated like any `@astrojs/*` integration:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
# upgrade Starstruck with npm
npm install @awe-player/starstruck@latest
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
# upgrade Starstruck with pnpm
pnpm upgrade @awe-player/starstruck --latest
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
# upgrade Starstruck with yarn
yarn upgrade @awe-player/starstruck --latest
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can see a full list of the changes made in each release in [the Starstruck changelog](https://github.com/withastro/starstruck/blob/main/packages/starstruck/CHANGELOG.md).

## Troubleshooting Starstruck

Both Starstruck [project configuration](/reference/configuration/) and [individual page frontmatter configuration](/reference/frontmatter/) information are available in the Reference section of this site. Use these pages to ensure that your Starstruck site is configured and functioning properly.

See the growing list of guides in the sidebar for help adding content and customizing your Starstruck site.
